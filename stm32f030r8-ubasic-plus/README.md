To build the uBasic-Plus for this evaluation board the following steps are required:

- create new project using, say ac6, and copy Inc and Src directories from the repository
- download the UART source and header from the Drivers/Src and Drivers/Inc folder and put them in the respective driver folder that your IDE has created for you.

The version posted here was built with ac6 and sw4stm32/cubemx environments.
